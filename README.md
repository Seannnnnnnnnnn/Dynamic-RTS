## Dynamic Range Thresholding on Streams
we study a  general type of computational geometry problem called dynamic range thresholding on streams (DRTS). DRTS problems involve stabbing queries over an unbounded stream of data, where the registered intervals of interest for the stabbing queries can also evolve over time. 

Contained in this repository is a notes for my Thesis, as well as software implementing DRTS algorithms and raw results data.
