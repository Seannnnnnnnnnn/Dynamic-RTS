\abstract{
  In this thesis we study an applied Computational Geometry problem known as \textit{Range Thresholding on Streams} (RTS). We review the state-of-the-art algorithm for the RTS problem, and present the details in a manner that is accessible to a wider audience, as well as providing proofs for claims omitted from the original paper \cite{GAN16}. In addition to reviewing the existing literature, we make our own contributions. First, we motivated and introduce a more-general problem which we call \textit{Dynamic Range Thresholding on Streams} (DRTS), and mathematically characterise when existing RTS algorithms can also solve DRTS. Finally, we introduce and analyse a novel approximation algorithm for the DRTS problem. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms have not only
